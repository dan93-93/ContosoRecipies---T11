This doesn't include the service repository in the tutorial, but does include the MongoDb connectivity

Not fully tested with the tutorial services but mananged to at least get it setup with some documentation from the below:

https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.14/reference/bson/mapping/

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mongo-app?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio

You'll need to install the community edition of MongoDB and recommend installing Compass too

Hopefully this helps everyone! Tweak whatever, I'm not precious, just fork the branch
